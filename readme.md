# Scraper Utilities 

Module with generic functions used while scraping websites. Currently WIP, with all functions in utils.py. 

## :hammer: Functionalities

So far, there are only 3 functionalities:
- Gets html document
- Removes html tags
- Downloads CSV file with URL
 
While learning more about webscraping, I intend to divide better the packages.
